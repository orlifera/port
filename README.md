# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



# Portfolio

Decided to create a bigger portfolio rather than the small ones we usually see, to showcase my modest skills in front-end Dev (and soon full stack). 

Created different pages usign   ` react-router-dom `, all of which had their components. 

I also linked a spotify API, just to teach myself how to handle those. 
The contact form works, of course, using EmailJS. 

This is still in update, so it might change over time.
